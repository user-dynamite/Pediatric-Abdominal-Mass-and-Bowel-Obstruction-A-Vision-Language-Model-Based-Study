**Background**: Pediatric abdominal mass and bowel obstruction are clinically important conditions that require timely and accurate diagnosis. Recent advances in vision–language models (VLMs) have enabled automated radiology report generation; however, the impact of report format on model performance and generalizability remains underexplored, particularly in multimodal pediatric settings. 
**Methods**: We quantitatively compared structured-text and free-text radiology reports for pediatric abdominal mass and bowel obstruction using integrated reports that consolidate abdominal X-ray and CT findings from the same clinical episode. A multimodal VLM was trained under identical conditions using each reporting format. Performance was evaluated using standard text-based metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore) and concept-level clinical completeness metrics assessing accuracy, completeness, and efficiency. Experiments were conducted on a multi-institutional cohort collected from three tertiary referral hospitals, with both internal and external validation. 
**Results**: Free-text–based training demonstrated notable performance degradation in external validation, particularly in text quality metrics, indicating sensitivity to inter-institutional variability. In contrast, structured-text–based training achieved more consistent performance across institutions, with stable text quality and higher clinical completeness accompanied by reduced variability. Qualitative analysis further showed that structured-text–generated reports exhibited clearer sentence structure, improved grammatical consistency, and more concise presentation of clinically relevant findings, whereas free-text–generated reports often contained ambiguous phrasing and non-essential information. 
**Conclusions**: These findings demonstrate that report structure acts as an important inductive bias in integrated radiology report generation. Structured-text–based training represents an effective strategy for improving robustness, generalizability, and clinical reliability of multimodal medical VLMs in multi-institutional settings.
